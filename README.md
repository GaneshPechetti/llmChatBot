# 🚀 **Chatbot using RAG, LangChain, and Streamlit** 🤖  

This repository contains a **chatbot application** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** concepts, **LangChain** libraries, and a touch of **prompt engineering**. The chatbot leverages the **Cohere API** to enhance its generative capabilities and features a user-friendly **Streamlit interface**.

## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot locally:

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

---

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**

Install all required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **3️⃣ Get the Cohere API Key 🔑**

1. Visit [Cohere's website](https://cohere.ai/) to create an account and get an API key.  
2. Save the API key securely into a `.env` file in the main directory like below — it will be required to run the chatbot.
```bash
COHERE_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY
```

---

### **4️⃣ Run the Chatbot 💻**

Launch the Streamlit interface using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run rag/app.py
```

✅ This will open the chatbot interface in your **default web browser**.

---

## ⚡ **How It Works**

1. **📥 Upload Documents**:  
   - Users upload PDFs or Word files through the Streamlit interface.  
   - Files are processed, and content is split into chunks using **LangChain** tools.

2. **💡 Query Processing**:  
   - Queries are matched to the most relevant document chunks (**retrieval** step).  
   - The retrieved content is passed to the **Cohere API** for final response generation (**generation** step).

3. **📝 Response**:  
   - The chatbot provides intelligent and **context-aware answers** based on the uploaded documents.
